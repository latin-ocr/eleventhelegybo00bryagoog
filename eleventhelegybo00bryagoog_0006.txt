THE elegiae couplet was naturalized in Latin literature during
the Augustan age. Of the elegiae poets of the period, Sextus
Propertius is the 'most eminent: His works are comprehended in
five books, from the last of which the following rendering is made',

This poem presents Cornelia, a member of the highest circle
of Rome, delivering from the under-world an elegy upon her own
death. It is not arranged by consistent plan, the address turning
now to the immediate Plutonian court, now to friends on earth.
The former are called upon to assure the future because of the
latter’s vindication of the past. It has been conjectured that the
verses were intended to adorn the mausoleum of the deceased
(cf. v. 36).

Critical opinion has always assigned to this elegiae the highest
rank not alone among the works of its author, but as well in all
productions of its like in the literature. It has been called “the
queen of elegies.'⁷ Mackail declares that in it “ art passes beyond
the reach of criticism.'' Ramsay pronounces it “a magnificent
poem '’ and refers to its “noble stateliness.'' The somewhat mala-
propos flattery of Augustus is but too characteristic of the time.
