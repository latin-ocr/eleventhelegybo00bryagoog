OF BOOK F] ΥΕ 9

Twice sat my brother in the chair of state,
There was he seated when my day was done3

- The censor's rule, my daughter, illustrate3

Like me, remember that you wed but one.

The sombre barque is fitizing now to leave,
And I am ready, — my repose I crave.
No fairer honour may a wife receive
Than fame's soff, fragrance shed above her grave.

Whom Ι relinquish I to you consign3
Solicitude breathes in my ashes yet.

Now varied services in you combine,
And on your shoulders many cares are metz.

A mother's kisses with your own bestow3
On you henceforward all the house must lean.
If aught you sorrow, do not let them knOW,
Nor weeping, suffer that your bears be seen.

Enough to pass long vigils of distreSS,

And trust, in visions that you see me nigh 3
My image oft in solitudo* addreSS,

As if the lips could proffer you reply.

But if with passing years a change succeed,
And set a strangffl‘· in my wonted place, —-
Children, show kindness in your word and deed,

For only kindness will secure her grace.
