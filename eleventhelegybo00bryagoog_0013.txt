OF BOOK FIVE 7

For me no censor turned the law aside‚

Nor does your hear‘ohs'oone wrong of mine confess.
Ι brought no stigma on your noble pride—

Myself the pattern of its nobleness.

Unchanged, unfailing on my way I went ;
Abode commended till my dying day3— .

My guide my conscience through my life's extent,
Unmoved by terror, and beyond its sway.

Though harshest sentence be pronounced on me,
No soul will shun me with a prend disdain:

Not thou that movedst stranded Cybele
‘When others laboured at the ropes in vain3

Not, thou that, sudden madesb flames to start
When Vesta charged thee to restore thy trust.

And, mother, never have Ι grieved thy hesma,
Save that I perished‚ as perforce Ι must.

A mother and a city mourn me dead3
My urn is hallowed by a Caesar’s grief.
All Rome beheld the godlike tears he shed‚

Tlia‘t, life so worthy should be made so brief.

When death approached to fasten on his prize‚
Two sons survivedome in the home bereft3

Supported by their arms Ι closed my eyes3

. They are my solace in the land Ι left.
