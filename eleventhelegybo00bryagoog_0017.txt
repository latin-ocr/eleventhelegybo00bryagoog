OF BOOK FIVE

Speak not o’ermuch of me in praiseful strain, ,

Lest it offend the jealous hears, to hear ;
But, if some memories he yet retain,
Or hold my ashes in regard so deam,—

Add to your years those holden years of mine,
Eaeh Wish -and frailty of your sire foresta113

Lend brightsomeness unto his day’s decline,
Permit no cares athwart his path to fall.

I rest eontent3 for though my span was brief,
Ι am emboldened net to deem it vain.
For none of mine I wore the Weeds of grief,

And none were missing from my funeral train.

My cause is plead. sad witnesses, arise,
And for the verdict on my life prepare.
So worth accord an aceess to the skies,

My soul shall find triumphant entrance there.
